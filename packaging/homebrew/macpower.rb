  caveats <<~EOS
    MacPower is ad-hoc signed (not notarized). If macOS blocks it on first
    launch, clear the download quarantine:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/MacPower.app"

    The optional "Exact energy" mode installs a passwordless-sudo rule at
    /etc/sudoers.d/macpower via an admin prompt. To remove it:

      sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/macpower
  EOS
